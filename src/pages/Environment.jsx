          We installed 10.56MWp Solar Power plant in Budhni in FY 23-24 and increased our total Solar capacity to 40.9 MWp by June 2024. With our dedicated efforts we have been able to increase our renewable energy share in total energy mix by 41.6 %.<br /><br />
          The Company targets 42% GHG emission reduction (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2031 compared to base year 2021.<br /><br />
          The Company has maintained the zero liquid discharge facility from the beginning of our operations and save more than six million litres of fresh water every day. The zero liquid discharge mechanism covers 100% of our towel and sheeting processing at Budhni location. The recovery of water is through a biological plant for biodegradation of wastewater, membrane technology, reverse osmosis and multi effect evaporator systems. This system recovers all the wastewater. The Company also treats water through effluent treatment plant at Punjab location and uses the same for gardening and horticulture purposes. The Company is one of the largest among industries, in terms of water recovery from waste streams capacity and best in class technology implementation.<br /><br />
          The Company is further committed to sustainability through our 5Rs Practice: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Re-engineer, and Redesign. We actively seek alternatives to plastic waste, partnering with recyclers for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) initiatives. E-waste is responsibly recycled at our collection centres, while hazardous waste like ETP Sludge is disposed of at authorized Treatment, Storage, and Disposal (TSD) Facilities.<br /><br />
          Our innovations include converting food and biomass waste into electricity via biogas plants and promoting sustainable paper packaging through our “Good Paper” campaign. We prioritize Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified papers, reducing carbon and water footprints compared to plastics. Trident remains dedicated to minimizing our environmental impact and promoting responsible resource management, showcasing our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship.<br /><br />
